# Employee-Management-Service
The Employee Management Service is a system designed to efficiently handle employee, department, and team data within an organization. This project revolves around the implementation of three distinct microservices, each dedicated to managing specific types of data:​

Employee Data Microservice: Manages individual employee records, including personal information, employment history and their benefits.​

Department Data Microservice: Handles department-related information such as department names, managers, and associated teams.​

Team Data Microservice: Focuses on team-specific details, including team members, projects, and assignments.
